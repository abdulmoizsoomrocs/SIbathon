# 💳 SplitSmart – Intelligent Group Expense Manager

## 📌 Problem Statement

Managing shared expenses among friends, roommates, and teams is often confusing and inefficient.

People commonly face:

- Difficulty calculating who owes whom  
- Multiple unnecessary money transfers  
- Lack of transparency in shared expenses  
- Miscommunication that leads to conflicts  

Most existing payment apps only enable transactions — they do not simplify or optimize group settlements.

## 💡 Our Solution

SplitSmart is a smart fintech application designed to simplify group expense management.

Our platform:

- Tracks shared expenses in real-time  
- Automatically calculates individual balances  
- Minimizes the number of transactions required to settle debts  
- Provides a clear and transparent settlement summary  

Instead of multiple back-and-forth payments, our system intelligently computes the most efficient way to settle balances.
